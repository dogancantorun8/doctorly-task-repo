Monitoring Strategy (Step-by-Step Roadmap)

1. Define Needs (SLI/SLOs)
   - Start by identifying what to measure: system health (CPU, disk, memory), 
     application performance (latency, error rate), and business metrics 
     (transactions, orders).
   - Define SLOs/thresholds for critical services (e.g., CPU > 90% for 5 minutes, 
     disk usage > 80%).

2. Centralized Monitoring Setup
   - Deploy a dedicated monitoring VM outside of production.
   - Run Prometheus (metrics collection) and Grafana (visualization) on this VM 
     to minimize load on production instances.

3. Agent / Exporter Deployment
   - Install Node Exporter on each Ubuntu production instance to capture 
     host-level metrics (CPU, disk, memory, I/O, network).
   - Add application-specific exporters if needed (e.g., nginx exporter, 
     postgres exporter).

4. Alerting and Automation
   - Configure basic system alerts: high CPU, memory pressure, disk usage, 
     network issues.
   - Configure application alerts: high error rate, slow response time, 
     service downtime.
   - Use Alertmanager to route alerts to Slack/email/PagerDuty.
   - Link alerts to runbooks so engineers know exactly how to respond.

5. Visualization and Analysis
   Build Grafana dashboards for:
   - Host metrics (CPU, disk, memory)
   - Application metrics (requests/sec, error rates)
   - Database metrics (query latency, replication lag)
   - Provide role-based access for different teams.

6. Continuous Improvement
   - Regularly review alerts to reduce noise and avoid alert fatigue.
   - Use trend analysis for capacity planning.
   - Treat monitoring as code: when new services are deployed, add corresponding 
     exporters, dashboards, and alerting rules via GitOps.
